# coerce - A MoonBit type coercion utility

This module just provides one function `coerce` and other examples, The purpose is to understand type conversion between MoonBit types.

Some explanations are derived from [haskell coerce](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.21.0.0/docs/Data-Coerce.html#v:coerce).

Similar notion in other languages like C++ [reinterpret_cast](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/reinterpret_cast).
